											<h3 className="text-center">It all started with simple curiosity</h3>
											<h5 className="fs-5 fw-medium mt-6">A literal clean slate that changed everything</h5>
											<p className="text-300">
												Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by how things work. In elementary school, I would marvel at websites and wonder how they could look so “beautiful.” I didn’t even know where to begin, but that curiosity drove me to explore design and technology on my own.
												<br /> Everything changed in high school when I got my first computer. I installed design programs, combined graphics with web pages, and experimented so much that I broke more things than I fixed.
												Design a clean and intuitive navigation structure. Ensure users can easily find what they’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed. Use familiar icons and clear labels to guide them.
											</p>

											<h5 className="fs-5 fw-medium mt-6">Design as a bridge to connect with people</h5>
											<p className="text-300">
												My first formal introduction to web design was at CCH Azcapotzalco, where I pursued a technical career in web development and design. That’s where I realized technology wasn’t just functional—it was emotional. Design has the power to change how people interact with the digital world. Even before I discovered UX/UI design, I knew I wanted to create experiences that were intuitive and visually engaging.
												<br />Years later, I worked on Renoshop.mx, a project that allowed me to elevate my vision for UX/UI design. The stakeholders wanted something beyond WordPress or Shopify templates, and that’s when I proposed tools like React, Node.js, and AWS. Not only did I implement a scalable e-commerce platform, but I also designed a custom editor that fulfilled the company’s vision. My work didn’t stop there—I took
												a step further by identifying outdated processes in other departments and proposed automation solutions. I led the implementation of an ERP system that transformed operational efficiency. These achievements earned me the role of CTO, proving that technology isn’t just a set of tools—it’s a way to drive business success and innovation.

											<h5 className="fs-5 fw-medium mt-6">Leadership: building teams and breaking barriers</h5>
											<p className="text-300">
												Since high school, I’ve naturally gravitated toward leadership roles. I’ve always enjoyed guiding others, helping them uncover their potential, and working together toward a shared goal. One of the most challenging moments in my leadership journey was at LALEO, where the IT department was perceived as egotistical and disconnected from the rest of the company. I made it my mission to change that.
												I started by listening to my team’s frustrations and connecting them with other departments. Something as simple as organizing a "carnita asada" (a BBQ gathering) one Friday was enough to break communication barriers. That small gesture brought the IT team closer to the rest of the company, fostering collaboration and improving the overall work environment.
												<br />At Ministerios La Hermosa, I faced another challenge during the pandemic. People couldn’t physically attend church, which disrupted their spiritual connection. Leveraging my IT and UX knowledge, I led the implementation of a live-streaming system that allowed people to stay connected and engaged. This experience taught me that technology can be a powerful tool to unite people during difficult times.

											<h5 className="fs-5 fw-medium mt-4">Innovation in the face of technological challenges</h5>
											<p className="text-300">
												Innovation has always been a driving force in my career. At LALEO, I implemented an AI-powered tool that transformed the experience for students and doctors, increasing conversion rates for book and medical equipment sales. At Renoshop.mx, I designed a technological ecosystem that automated key processes and significantly enhanced the company’s operational efficiency.
												I implemented security cameras, optimized workflows in their workshop, and elevated their technological infrastructure to unprecedented levels.
												<br />However, not everything has been smooth sailing. Technological challenges and high expectations have often tested my limits. But I’ve always viewed obstacles as opportunities to learn and grow. From designing fluid animations that improved user engagement to implementing offline capabilities in critical applications, every project has been a step forward in creating more impactful and creative solutions.

													Throughout my life, every step I’ve taken has been guided by curiosity and a desire to learn. From the experiments that led me to wipe operating systems to leading multidisciplinary teams and transforming businesses, my purpose has always been the same: to solve problems with creativity, empathy, and a clear vision. Every project, every challenge, and every achievement has taught me that true impact goes beyond technical results; it’s reflected in the people, the connections we create, and the solutions we build together.
													<br />This is not the end of my story—it’s only the beginning of everything that’s still to come.
